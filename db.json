Maria Pearson again because she is waiting for surgery to address injuries she sustained that made it impossible to campaign. But she still wanted to participate in the 2018 municipal campaign. So when Louie Milojevic, 37, asked her to run his Ward 10 campaign, she jumped at the chance. \u201cWe share some of the priorities,\u201d said DiFalco. \u201cHe supported me when I ran. I believe in his passion for this community.\u201d DiFalco, along with Luana Yachetti, who came second and third respectively behind Pearson in the 2014 election, are endorsing Milojevic in his second bid to upset the 15 year incumbent. Milojevic has previously run in the 2003 municipal election. Also running in Ward 10 are Ian Thompson and Stoney Creek public school trustee Jeff Beattie. Di Falco said Milojevic\u2019s campaign is focusing on responsible development, providing better services, good governance, protecting residents from the possible impact of a new cannabis grow operation in the Players Paradise building, and engaging with the community. \u201cThe incumbent has not called one community engagement session in all of the years in office,\u201d said DiFalco. Milojevic, who held an outdoor barbecue event Sept. 11 that attracted over 50 people, said Ward 10 residents feel \u201cjustifiably left out\u201d of the political process. Milojevic commits to creating a community council to allow residents a chance to discuss issues with their representative, such as whether to support Hamilton\u2019s $1 billion light rail transit project. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of pro-LRT or no LRT in Stoney Creek,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what LRT. The community hasn\u2019t communicated these things. Stoney Creek hasn\u2019t had a say.\u201d Milojevic has made it clear he is &#8220;categorically against&#8221; the $1 billion project. He said residents \u201cwant services and they are willing to pay for it\u201d such as transit. Under the current area-rating tax policy for transit, taxpayers pay for the service they are receiving. Some urban councillors are looking at eliminating area rating in the next term of council. He said providing trans cab for people is a band-aid solution to the area\u2019s lack of transit service that can\u2019t last forever. Milojevic, a private equity investor, who has worked as a college history professor in the United States, said residents also need a recreation facility, an issue that was prominently debated in the 2010 municipal election in Winona. He said the Winona public school which was built since the 2010 election isn\u2019t enough to address the recreation service deficit in the area. \u201cWe are the most under serviced wards in the city,\u201d said Milojevic. \u201c(People) want a place so they can play squash, have a get together and socialize so seniors are not isolated. Winona needs services.\u201d In a nod to seniors, Milojevic is also prepared to reduce the age requirement for free transit rides for seniors on the city\u2019s buses from 80 years to 75 years. \u201cPeople want change in this ward,\u201d said Milojevic. \u201cThey want new leadership.\u201d", "link": "https://www.thespec.com/news-story/8904265-stoney-creek-s-ward-10-louie-milojevic-gets-some-political-support-from-past-candidates/", "img_api": "http://media.zuza.com/b/2/b2544105-12d4-4948-af2c-13786ae4635c/P1210120___Super_Portrait.jpg", "img_api_thumb": "http://media.zuza.com/b/2/b2544105-12d4-4948-af2c-13786ae4635c/P1210120___150x100.jpg", "pubdate_api": "2018-09-16T12:20:04.493", "timestamp": "09-16 12:20 pm", "site_api": "Stoney Creek News", "author_api": "Kevin Werner", "label_api": "Kevin Werner | Stoney Creek News", "draft_api": false}, "86": {"desc_user": "", "draft_user": 0, "rank": 0, "rank_time": 0, "label_user": "", "title_user": "", "tags_user": [], "asset_id": "8903483", "title_api": "Hands Off Hamilton rally kicks off opposition to Doug Ford&#8217;s government, say activists", "source_api": "", "tags_api": [], "caption_api": "Chris Labenski, (with sign) applauds with the rest of over 120 people who attended the Hands Off Hamilton rally Sept. 15 at city hall.

And Mayor Fred Eisenberger is listening to their concerns. \u201cI heard that today (in Waterdown),\u201d said Eisenberger, during an interview at the Jitterbug Caf\u00e9 on Sept. 20. The mayor said he is willing to support hiring more police officers, but he was hesitant to identify a particular number. He said the Hamilton Police Service has a lower per capita number of officers than the provincial average, which is \u201cputting some strain on our police service. I\u2019m in favour of having more police. The right number is something I don\u2019t have.\u201d Ward 10 candidate Ian Thompson is campaigning to hire 30 additional police officers, which would translate into two more officers per ward. Thompson recently said Hamilton Police is \u201cunderstaffed and they cannot serve the public in our area because they don\u2019t have the manpower.\u201d In the 2018 budget, city council approved hiring seven civilian crime officers and two new sworn officers. It costs about $125,000 to hire one officer. Ward 10 Coun. Maria Pearson said that it will be difficult to blanket the entire city with officers to combat traffic violations and break-ins. \u201cShort of putting a police officer on every corner and in every neighbourhood you will not be able to do that effectively,\u201d she recently said. Eisenberger dismissed the idea of hiring 30 officers Thompson has proposed, saying that is a number \u201cthat is pulled out of the air.\u201d He wants to discuss the issue with Police Chief Eric Girt and other police experts before deciding on a specific number. But Eisenberger points out that based upon Hamilton\u2019s recent crime statistics break-ins and vandalism are trending downwards. \u201cI\u2019m for making sure the right level of policing has a presence in Waterdown, having a presence in Ancaster,\u201d he said. \u201cI will be ensuring the presence is where it is needed.\u201d In Waterdown, for instance, Eisenberger talked about the need for a community policing facility and \u201cdown the road a full-fledged police station.

Responses are featured in alphabetical order, by ward. Some candidates did not respond to the Review\u2019s invitation by the deadline. Their answers to the Q-and-A will be posted to the Review&#8217;s website upon receipt. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 UPDATE: This story was edited Oct. 2 to include Ward 15 councillor candidate Susan McKechnie&#8217;s submission. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 QUESTION 1: What do you feel is the number 1 issue affecting residents of Flamborough and what is your strategy to tackle this issue? WARD 12 Lloyd Ferguson: I believe preservation of prime agricultural land is important to make sure farmers have the resources to feed cities. I grew up on a dairy farm in rural Ancaster and still live there so I understand the rural way of life. Maintenance of rural roads is another important issue. Miranda Reis: Fiscal responsibility and proper use of taxpayer funds. Ancaster-Flamborough residents pay some of the highest property taxes in the entire City of Hamilton, and municipal services especially in Flamborough are minimal. I am a chartered professional accountant and have been a farmer for the past 20 years. City project cost overruns and delays are simply unacceptable. I believe city management should be held accountable to ensure the best use of your taxpayer dollars. I will fight hard for you, the taxpayer. I was former budget manager for the City of Cambridge. I dealt with mayor and council on major issues and reports; budget control, reserve fund analysis, tangible capital asset implementation (which was nearly $1 billion in total asset cost). I was also part of the Life Cycle and Infrastructure Funding strategic team. If you want someone who is a CPA and who has many years of municipal finance experience to take a hard look at the numbers, dive into the details, rein in budget spending, find cost efficiencies and bring accountability and integrity to the council table then please vote for me on Oct. 22. WARD 13 Gaspare Bonomo: The most common issues affecting a majority of people these days seems to be affordable housing and improved public transit. Flamborough has an extensive rural area with a significant inventory of land. The main reason for the unmanageable housing costs these days is because of the cost of developable land. One way of creating affordable housing is by allowing small multi unit developments, such as duplexes and triplexes. Most people would probably prefer to be in a more spacious unit with less intensification. We need to support these types of developments so they can build. For example a lot these days can run you $450,000, if you build a single-family home on that lot for another $450,000 you would have an unaffordable $900,000 home. If you took that same building lot and built comfortable two-bedroom triplex units, the cost of that lot would then be split three ways. The building costs would increase to $600,000 or perhaps $750,000. That would still provide you with three units at $350,000 to $400,000, which now would be more affordable for young families and our seniors. Low cost bank financing needs to be made available for these types of developments. If you can reduce the cost of land and the cost of financing you are almost there at creating affordable housing. You also need the co-operation from the City of Hamilton. The City of Hamilton development charges are currently set at $38,000 per unit and multi-unit developments are generally charged a higher property tax rate than single-family housing. We need to provide our seniors with property tax rebates based on income so they can continue to live in their homes. Rich Gelder: The top issue facing Flamborough is a sense of alienation from the rest of the region and the belief that rural residents are not well served by the current municipal structure. While there are common interests across Hamilton, there are distinct needs in our rural communities as well as a sense that sometimes city government just needs to &#8220;lay off.\u201d Planning and zoning principles that work in the urban core simply aren&#8217;t applicable in rural settings. And although all parts of the city can and must contribute to the tax base, there is a delicate balance to be maintained in rural communities. There are pressures to develop land. And, although greenbelt legislation precludes much intense development, there is still a pressure to have agricultural land used for larger quasi-industrial purposes. There are environmental, tax base, and local nuisance balances to be maintained. Kevin Gray: Flamborough residents feel left out at city hall when it comes to their needs, financial contributions and being kept in the loop for growth and development. Farming in these areas bring $2 billion of revenue. This needs to taken serious as business that contributes to overall revenue. Council needs to better understand that Hamilton is not just about the &#8220;core.&#8221; John Mykytyshyn: Value for money and respect, they go hand in hand. Hamilton council is using Flamborough as an income stream without providing the level of service that the community needs and deserves. If Flamborough was being treated fairly the crumbling roads, Waterdown bypass, traffic congestion, and other issues wouldn\u2019t exist today. But they do for a reason. In my opinion, downtown councillors take every chance they can from Flamborough and not give anything back but the bare minimum. It is easier for them to pay lip service than to actually care about fair service in exchange for taxes collected. The ward boundary changes are a good example of this. At the time of amalgamation promises were made that the legacy communities would be guaranteed a seat at the table, a councillor for each of the original municipalities, until such time as the population rose, through development where the communities would stand on their own. The recent OMB decision ignored that principle and Hamilton council failed to act. They should have appealed the decision. They should have gone to the premier and fought for Flamborough, Dundas, Ancaster, etc. but they didn\u2019t. If elected I will fight to right this wrong. John Roberts: The top issue that I believe is affecting Flamborough residents is that we are not seeing the benefits of being a part of &#8220;big city Hamilton.&#8221; I believe that there is power in numbers. I would want to work with other rural councillors that also face this issue including the Waterdown and Glanbrook area so that we could come together and bring our concerns to city hall. By coming together, I believe we have a greater chance at having the voices of Flamborough heard and acknowledged. I would also work with the voters to better understand why they are feeling neglected by the City of Hamilton and bring these issues forwards as well. Arlene VanderBeek: Generally, taxes, road conditions and traffic are the top issues in Flamborough, as a whole, but Greensville would likely feel that the impact from Webster&#8217;s and Tews Falls is paramount, followed by the rebuilding of the Greensville and Beverly schools. I will continue to champion every issue \u2014 working hard to keep the tax increases as low as possible and continuously addressing the issues that impact the residents of the various communities in Flamborough. WARD 15 Susan McKechnie: The number one issue residents talk to me about is the issue of traffic and the drastic safety implications that appear as a result of the municipality and previous council not solving these issues. Across Ward 15, residents echo the concern about safety at the top of their list. The inability of previous council to move the bypass forward has made this traffic issue an even greater safety concern as the short-term consequences have now converted urban and rural routes into dangerous roads. Speeding in the country and inexplicable congestion in the suburban areas affects all ward residents. To deal with this, I will pursue a two-part strategy. I will make the by-pass a priority, securing support with the new council and mayor and moving in a determined manner by making this a top priority now. The funding, the land acquisitions, the relevant rezoning must be placed as a city-wide high priority. This has not been the case to date. The second part of my strategy will focus on dealing with the dangerous traffic now. Broad dialogue with all stakeholders including municipal planning, bylaw, and resident groups will lead to immediate implementation of traffic easing and safety enhancing strategies that will aim to keep our community safe and buy us the time that is needed to put in place longer term comprehensive solutions with infrastructure improvements, including the bypass. Judi Partridge: High property taxes remain the top issue for urban Waterdown and rural Flamborough. The city budget is $2.2 billion capital and operating, yet almost 40 per cent of the operating budget is provincially mandated, which means council has no say on those budgets. Around the time of amalgamation in the late 1990s, the province downloaded the cost of police, fire and paramedics to the local tax base. At the same time the province downloaded other social service costs to municipalities. The province used to pay for all these costs until they were added to the local tax base making it impossible for cities not to raise taxes. Over the past two terms of council I have championed Value for Money auditing which is now done annually outside of the regular annual auditing functions. I believe we need to go line by line through every budget looking for efficiencies resulting in savings. Although recent tax increases have been held to less than the rate of inflation 2.2 per cent, overall Flamborough/Hamilton taxes are too high. We have now started a multi-year budget process, which I advocated for and council has approved. Both the capital budget committee and multi-year budget committee are two of the most important recent council committees, which I now vice-chair. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 For more coverage of the municipal election, visit the Review&#8217;s website at www.flamboroughreview.com.

What are your plans to get people moving? WARD 12 Lloyd Ferguson: My main congestion issue is Highway 403 in both directions from Wilson Street in Ancaster to Highway 6 North. I will continue to lobby the provincial government to widen, by one lane in each direction, this stretch of road. They have already agreed to start the environmental assessment for the project. Miranda Reis: We need to stop the LRT and use those funds for more cost effective traffic solutions. Improved transit is the way of the future for the BLAST lines identified in the Transportation Master Plan meaning the A (Airport), S (Ancaster-Elfrida), T (Meadowlands-Lime Ridge Mall), L (Waterdown) lines with express or rapid buses as these are the routes that will alleviate the traffic issues. We need to immediately address the bottleneck of West Harbour GO Station connection to Aldershot GO so Hamiltonians can have access to the GTA 100 per cent of the time and turn the brownfields around the West Harbour GO into overflow parking. This is the time for action. We are at a critical point in the LRT process, if contracts are signed and then the city pulls out of the LRT deal, the city will be sued and more tax dollars will be wasted. LRT projects in Kitchener and Ottawa have been plagued with cost overruns. Ottawa had a lawsuit. Kitchener was pushed aside by Toronto and is still awaiting functional LRT train service \u2014 new estimates are that train service will be active in December. I would also support more on and off ramps to Highway 403 to alleviate traffic issues. WARD 13 Rich Gelder: Although not in Ward 13, the first priority is the timely completion of the Waterdown bypass. There are many people in the ward for whom transportation other than their car or truck is not an option, and we need to make the streets of Waterdown more livable, walkable and bikeable by diverting that &#8220;passing through&#8221; vehicle traffic away from the core. At the same time, we need to be looking at expanding public transit where warranted. Although there is transit going between Waterdown and the Aldershot GO Station, we need to be insisting that the city get back on track with the 10-year Transit Plan, including the BLAST network which will provide bus rapid transit between Flamborough and downtown Hamilton. We also need to have a conversation about expanding transit service \u2014 rush hour service at a minimum \u2014 to communities like Greensville. John Mykytyshy: Congestion is a problem and can be a direct result of bad planning. Do you first build the homes or the streets? Is the infrastructure in place to accommodate the impact on the existing community needs or is the plan to wait until there is a crisis situation or a fatality to get the attention of decision makers? Waterdown is a great example of what happens when you overload a local road \u2014 traffic crawls and then stops, people get frustrated, no one feels well served by those who are supposed to be \u201cin charge.\u201d Proper planning would have anticipated the current situation. Also, a realistic world view. Cars are the prime choice of transportation by the majority of citizens and as such car drivers need to be treated with respect. Working with the community to find the best possible solution is what is needed. And there may have to be trade-offs in the priorities. Is the issue one of a moderate delay or a chronic unworkable situation. Both types deserve different treatment, different focus and different solutions. We need consultation then action, not endless delays or waiting lists for action that become wish lists kicking the issue down the road. Arlene VanderBeek: The Waterdown bypass should have been constructed before significant development was approved and should be prioritized for completion immediately. The people of Waterdown and Flamborough have waited long enough. WARD 15 Susan McKechnie: The issue of traffic is at the top of the list for most residents. Most see it, not only as an immediate congestion concern, but they see it more broadly as a safety concern. Rural residents are asking for speed mitigating approaches to intercept dangerous rural collisions. Urban residents see traffic congestion and are asking for traffic alleviation through infrastructure improvements, and appropriate planning solutions. The solutions to congestion need to be delivered in both the short and long term. Long-term infrastructure improvements, including the bypass, must address not only the present day demand of the existing population, but these solutions must address the ongoing increased demand of future populations. With a projected growth of over 40 per cent, the solutions delivered must address the expected volume of future residents. Major arterial road infrastructure in Ward 15 has not changed since at least the 1990s yet the population has nearly doubled in size. This approach must change at City Hall. I will champion the need to invest appropriately in infrastructure before further development continues. Residents have a valid concern. Current renovations on roads including Parkside Drive reconstruction must address this future demand. Judi Partridge: The number one issue in Hamilton is speeding and traffic congestion. In Waterdown/Flamborough there needs to be a three-prong approach to address traffic congestion as well as the ever increasing cut through traffic in neighbourhoods. First priority now that funding is secured is to complete the Waterdown East West Bypass; second to deny high-density core developments until new road infrastructure is complete; and third, to implement recommendations of the new Waterdown Traffic Master Plan currently underway to be completed spring 2019. The most pressing infrastructure need to be completed is the Waterdown Bypass East West Corridor, which includes new infrastructure roads within the new developments. These new roads will open up additional arterial road connections to get the traffic off of Dundas Street to spread the flow of traffic around Waterdown. Parkside Drive upgrades are now complete, which widened the road to include a safer continuous centre turn lane, sidewalks, boulevards and bike lanes on both sides with four additional stoplights to control the flow of traffic and a pedestrian crossing for WDHS students. Clappison Drive behind Boston Pizza is under construction to connect to Parkside Drive to be completed late fall 2018. This will get traffic off Hamilton and Dundas streets, as well as Hollybush Drive to better access Clappison and Highway 6. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 For more coverage of the municipal election, visit the Review&#8217;s website at www.flamboroughreview.com.

If elected, would you be in favour or opposed to a Burlington takeover. Please explain your position. WARD 12 Lloyd Ferguson: I don\u2019t believe it is a real issue. It is, in my view, a political move to take attention away from the new Burlington Official Plan, which permits higher density to meet the growth targets set out by the Provincial Policy and Places to Grow. By suggesting Waterdown annex deflects the criticism of the new downtown Burlington building height issue. Miranda Reis: I am opposed to the Burlington takeover of Waterdown. Burlington is only looking to expand their tax base through the Places to Grow legislation and definitely wants the current tax base dollars of Waterdown to flow their way. I believe that the current council\u2019s in fighting, delays, deferrals and quorum issues have made a dysfunctional environment that has sparked this debate. CBC News did an article of how often does your councillor show up? Ward 12\u2019s incumbent missed 19 per cent of meetings. I say if you don\u2019t show up for work, you should pay part of your salary back to the taxpayers. If elected I would forge relationships with all councillors and move Hamilton forward in the right direction together, solving our high property tax issues, moving the flow of traffic and attracting jobs and businesses to Ward 12 and to Hamilton. This is the time to work together with one another and stop the in fighting and the grand standing. WARD 13 Rich Gelder: I would be opposed to a Burlington takeover of Waterdown, or any other part of Flamborough being annexed elsewhere. I believe there are mutual benefits to Flamborough and Waterdown being part of a Greater Hamilton. I believe that servicing a city with as wide an expanse as does Hamilton, in terms of road plowing and maintenance, garbage collection, hydro and other services is a challenge. However, I believe that we have struck a balance in terms of services provided and taxes paid through creative means like area rating. I don&#8217;t believe that Burlington, with its own development challenges, necessarily has the best interests of Waterdown in mind with this out-of-nowhere proposal. The City of Hamilton needs to constantly reach out the furthest areas of the region to ensure that the needs of all residents are being met. Otherwise, a sense of alienation will only grow. Ultimately, it should be up to the people of Waterdown and Flamborough as to their future in terms of municipal association. I, for one, would oppose either Waterdown or Flamborough going anywhere. John Mykytyshyn: Opposed. But I\u2019m open to an amalgamation of Burlington with Hamilton! This would give all the legacy municipalities true balance with the downtown councillors. The original amalgamation studied various options in order to replace the two-tier regional government structure with a single tier. My concern then, and of many others, was that in time, downtown Hamilton would take the legacy municipalities for granted and treat us like we were just another of their small neighbourhoods. That was never the intention. The legacy communities of Flamborough, Dundas, etc. were to be protected until such time as our populations approached the city\u2019s wards in size. Sadly, what I feared has happened, this original understanding has been forgotten and the only way to ensure good government, without downtown Hamilton dominating, would have been to have included Burlington in the amalgamation. Perhaps Burlington might consider joining Hamilton. Since Mayor Rick Goldring wants to join part of Hamilton why not all of it? Think of the possibilities. A new council would be open to new possibilities the current council wouldn\u2019t consider. We share the escarpment, the harbour, Lake Ontario, major transportation routes. Perhaps it\u2019s time? Arlene VanderBeek: The mayor of Burlington has used this as an election ploy to garner publicity. I don&#8217;t think we should give it any credibility at this point in time. WARD 15 Susan McKechnie: The conversation that Burlington mayoral candidate RIck Goldring started was isolated to just him. He did not have broad Burlington Council support, nor did he engage in public dialogue about this topic. He did activate a serious interest many Waterdown residents may have been feeling. This issue however is a provincial issue. The province made the decision to amalgamate and the province would be the one to determine if de-amalgamation was a real option. This decision is highly complex and would have enormous political and financial costs associated with it. Who would fund the acquisition of municipal assets? Who would fund things like existing staff salaries or pensions? Where might the boundary rest? Is this a Waterdown question or a Ward 15 question? The questions are massive and answering them would be critical in advance of any conversation about this topic. I do not feel that our current ward councillor should have waded into this issue. My concern is that this action has alienated us with fellow councillors at Hamilton City Hall. What has happened as a result of Goldring&#8217;s publicity stunt is that Ward 15 residents were reminded that they pay the highest level of tax in Hamilton and residents \u2013 again \u2013 began to question whether they are receiving value for that tax contribution. Judi Partridge: It is important to recognize this is a one sided conversation between the mayor of Burlington and the provincial minister of municipal affairs. I received a heads up from the mayor of Burlington that he would raise the issue for discussion with the minister. There have been no formal talks between Burlington, Hamilton and Flamborough. My position is always to be open to any discussion especially if the proposal could have a positive outcome for my Flamborough residents. In my experience with corporate business, mergers and acquisition, these conversations take place all the time \u2014 they start with the question \u201cwhat is the financial implications and is there a solid business case to support it?\u201d And to be clear, for me the discussion is a non-starter unless it includes all of Ward 15 east of Highway 6 including Clappison Corners business parks. East Flamborough has a long history with Burlington. Although it may be a natural fit, it would depend on what the cost would be for residents. Hamilton owns all the public buildings and public assets of Waterdown/East Flamborough \u2014 will the province cover the purchase costs or will Burlington/Halton Region? There is no guarantee taxes would be lower and many questions exist. And, there must be public consultation. Ultimately any merger of Waterdown/East Flamborough with Burlington/Halton Region will be decided by the provincial government. And must first be approved by both Burlington and Hamilton councils to even start the conversation. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 For more coverage of the municipal election, visit the Review&#8217;s website at www.flamboroughreview.com.

Responses are featured in alphabetical order, by ward. Some candidates did not respond to the Review\u2019s invitation by the deadline. Their answers to the Q-and-A will be posted to the Review&#8217;s website upon receipt. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 UPDATE: This story was edited Oct. 2 to include Ward 15 councillor candidate Susan McKechnie&#8217;s submission. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 QUESTION 2: Given that each Flamborough ward includes a rural and urban component, if elected, how will you balance conflicting priorities? WARD 12 Lloyd Ferguson: I don\u2019t believe we have conflicting issues. High taxes are an issue for both residents. My business acumen and relentless quest for cost reduction will continue. Council colleagues refer to me as Frugal Fergie. Miranda Reis: I am a chartered professional accountant but I have also been a farmer for the past 20 years and I have lived in the ward for 42 years. I understand the unique issues facing the constituents of rural Flamborough, like barn permits, cisterns, irrigation, livestock and fencing issues. I stand with you farmer to farmer and I feel I am the best candidate to represent you in Ward 12. I believe the current area service rating system is a fair system for Sheffield, Troy, Lynden, Orkney, Copetown and Jerseyville. The current area service rating system keeps public transit operating cost component off of your property tax bills, this is only fair since the taxpayers of Flamborough do not receive any public transit services and our property tax bills are high enough. We are on the forefront of a historic time in Hamilton. I will assure the $1.3 billion committed to Hamilton by the province is used on time and on budget. I will fight hard for Ward 12 to have equal access to those funds in Ancaster-Flamborough to make sure our roads, bridges, roundabouts, sidewalks, water and sewer lines and transit are safe for the people. WARD 13 Gaspare Bonomo: In order to balance conflicting priorities you need to have a clear understanding of what they are and make some compromises in an effort to address both concerns. This may be an opportunity to set up a Flamborough council made up of 10-12 members elected from various areas to represent Flamborough and their different needs. Conflicting priorities could then be discussed and agreed to by Flamborough residents sitting on this representative council. This decision would then be brought to city hall through your elected council member. I believe that a majority of the time, with full open discussion, a win-win opportunity can be found. With an engineering background, I look forward to dealing with challenges and finding the most effective and affordable solution. Rich Gelder: The forced ward redistribution has created a unique set of circumstances and a very diverse ward in Dundas and West Flamborough. There is a large suburban component in the western part of Dundas, a quasi-urban setting in downtown Dundas, as well as the rural homes and farms of West Flamborough. These distinctions ought be respected as a function of planning and how we levy taxes. There is a coming reckoning on the issue of area rating for public transit. Although I believe many parts of Dundas are crying out for better transit, there is a large geographic component of the ward for which transit simply isn&#8217;t feasible; it isn&#8217;t coming any time soon. As such, I believe that any such area rating change should reflect a straight urban-rural split. That means that if you don&#8217;t receive transit nor will receive it any time soon, you simply don&#8217;t pay for it on your tax bill. Kevin Gray: I don&#8217;t see it as conflicting priorities I just see it as different needs within an area. I will work with the different regions between residential of Freetown and rural region of Rockton or Milgrove and farming areas to ensure all residents feel included and their opinions matter. Also to provide information that is going on at city hall to keep communication strong. John Mykytyshyn: The best way of doing this is to fight to have the original ward restored. Until that is done then it is treating each community, and there are many within both Dundas and Flamborough, both as cherished neighbourhoods and treating each person with the respect they deserve. I think part of the problem is choosing one priority over another under the idea of balance. Picking winners and losers leads to the type of frustration we have now where some people are talking about Waterdown leaving and joining Burlington. Should Dundas follow? Should other communities choose the next closest city of Cambridge or Brantford? I don\u2019t think so. Hamilton\u2019s various communities must be respected and the issues and priorities of each must be addressed through finding common cause, working together and finding workable solutions. Existing problems won\u2019t be solved by switching for a new dominant partner. What Ward 13 needs is a strong voice. A new representative who will fight for them and make sure Flamborough\u2019s collective voice is heard. What is not needed is someone who throws up their hands and says there is no option, or who simply goes along because that&#8217;s what the staff say. Arlene VanderBeek: The rural interests of Flamborough will be front and centre as I work to ensure that our agricultural community does not get left behind. I will continue the work of Coun. Robert Pasuta to respond to the rural area and will work for our fair share of the tax dollars we pay. At the same time, I will continue to push for the road maintenance and other infrastructure investments necessary to meet the needs of both the urban and rural areas of the ward. We will work together. WARD 15 Susan McKechnie: Over the course of the past six months, I have met with thousands of rural and suburban residents. Their concerns come from different geographic points of reference, but the key issues are consistent. All residents want a municipal government that is fiscally responsible and deals appropriately with their need for safety and security. In our rural area, residents talk about reckless speed and lack of enforcement, while our suburban residents talk about an inability to move efficiently because of a lack of traffic planning. Both concerns are based on the principle of proper planning and proper delivery of enforcement tools. The key to success in dealing with these issues is listening to their needs. Both rural and suburban residents are \u201ccustomers\u201d who need their voice is heard. I keep listening and want residents to know that their voice matters. If elected, I will continue to listen and take action that positively affects the key concerns we all have. Judi Partridge: The issues are different and equally complex in the urban area of Waterdown and the rural Flamborough areas including the rural settlement areas of Flamborough Centre, Carlisle, Millgrove, Mountsberg and Freelton. One of my key areas of knowledge is planning, zoning and understanding the provincial legislation complexities within these jurisdictions. Greenbelt, Source Water Protection (Clean Water Act), Niagara Escarpment Commission, Conservation Authority \u2014 all these provincial legislations control development for residents, farmers, landscapers and businesses operating in the rural areas. Having a solid understanding of the legislation is key to working with city staff and businesses to get it right. As an example, Carlisle has a development freeze due to the ground water aquifer that feeds the community, which is considered at risk. As a councillor, I play an active role in working with residents and business owners in Waterdown/Flamborough on land use developments. Residents need to have a say in future urban expansion in Waterdown. Although the current housing developments cannot be stopped, there are other proposed developments that residents can influence. I am committed to working with residents to fight future Waterdown developments at the new Land Tribunal that do not fit with existing neighbourhoods. The new bypass road infrastructure must be completed first. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 For more coverage of the municipal election, visit the Review&#8217;s website at www.flamboroughreview.com.
